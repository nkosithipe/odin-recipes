<h2>Dumbling Recipe</h2>
<p><strong>Dumbling</strong> or "Dombolo" as it is affectionately known among the South African households is a soft steamed-like bread made out of flour.</p> 
<p>Any relish fits well with <strong>Dumbling</strong> so long you can avoid disgusting those that don't like soggy crumbs, that's if you had planned to couple your meal with gravy or soup. It may be enjoyed as a sandwich with pastes or extras of your choice.</p>

<p>Today I present to you the manner in which my Grandmother used to prepare it, and never have I ever tasted any other <em>Dumbling</em> as delicious and filling as herein shared should you follow the steps correctly.</p>
